import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const singleUseCode = `cast get https://example.com/api/v1`;
export const filename = "request.http";

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash

<Steps>
1. Create a new file to store the request:

    ```bash
    touch request.http
    ```

2. Open the newly created file with your favorite text editor and add the following HTTP request:

   ```http
   GET /resources HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Authorization: Bearer example123
   ```

3. Run the following command using Cast:

   ```bash
   cast file request.http
   ```

4. A truncated response and run summary should then be displayed:

   ```
   test.http: Success
   ────────────────────
   # of requests: 1
   # of failures: 0
   Duration: 210 ms
   ```
